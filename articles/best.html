                  <h1>Skyla :)</h1>
                  <p>What makes Skyla the best? Well everything, her smile, her beautiful eyes, her laugh. There is only one thing id ever change about her. That one thing, is the way that she see's herself. Id make it so she could see the true beauty that I see. Id make it so she views her imperfections as perfections. Id change that and only that. Everything about her is what makes her amazing.</p>
                  <h2>But wait theres more!</h2>
                    <p>I love everything about her. I love her so much. I would honestly do absolutely anything for this girl. I absolutely love talking to her. She makes me so happy that it's honestly crazy. we've had countless conversations, and we've talked about so much already. And I want to talk about everything with her that we havent already talked about. Not to mention, I want to do everything with her. I want to cook her dinner. I want to take her out. I want to get her nice things. I want to do things that she loves. I want to do anything and everything for Skyla. </p>
                  <h2>What else?</h2>
                  <p>Skyla is literally the best girl ive ever known. She is perfect in every way. I know ive repeated some of the same stuff throughout this whole thing, but it doesnt change the fact that it's how I feel. And it's very important to me that she understands too. Because I want her to know how much value and how muchs shes truly worth to me. I want her to understand the exact way I feel about her, which I dont even think is possible.</p>
                  <h2>What's it like without her?</h2>
                  <p>Without Skyla, everything feels dull. She shines brighter than the sun, and without my sun, it gets dark out. When she isnt there, not talking to me, snapping me, things just dont feel complete. It takes a short amount of time for me to miss her as well. Skyla makes me feel something ive never felt. When shes gone, I cant help but think about her. I think about how pretty she is, I think about how she talks and what she says. I think about her so much. I see things and I wonder what Skyla's opinion would be or what she would think of it. But it's not just when I see things. Everything I do personally I feel that way too. Anytime I make a 3D model, or a skate edit, or anything of that nature, im always excited to show Skyla.</p>
                  <h2>So what's the point of this?</h2>
                  <p>Well for one, I wanted to write this article to help Skyla understand what she means to me and why. But originally, this was my way of asking her to be mine. But now she is mine, which is hard to believe sometimes. The way that she cares about me is unmatched by anyone else. She shows genuine intrest in me and what I do, and I've never had anyone like that in my life until Skyla. Shes so pretty, it's crazy to me when she doesnt see herself as being beautiful because she always is. She would have to try extremely hard to not be pretty, to the point that surgery would be required to completely change her face. That's how pretty she really is. But it isnt just the look of Skyla that im in love with. It's her entire being. It's her beautiful face. It's her perfect smile. It's her humor. It's her personality as a whole. It is every small detail of Skyla.</p>
			<h2>The future.</h2>
			<p>The future is something im very excited for with Skyla. I want to have a future with her. I want to do everything with Skyla and I would especially like to grow old with her. Id like to spend the rest of my life with her. She is beautiful, in every sense of the word. She has an effect on me like no other. And because of that, I would like to do everything for her and with her. Id like to make a life with Skyla, and I want to make her happy 24/7. And Skyla, I love you so much. More than you could possibly understand. You are perfect.</p>
